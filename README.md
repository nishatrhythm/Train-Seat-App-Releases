## Important: Why Railway Credentials are Needed in Train Seat App

>To search for train tickets on the official e-ticket website or Rail Sheba app, you need to be logged in with your railway account. This is because the railway system checks if you're a registered user before showing any information. Without proper login details, the app can't access the official data.
>
>Recently, Bangladesh Railway added extra security with Cloudflare verification for logins. Because of this change, we can't automatically get your Auth Token and Device Key from just your phone number and password. You'll need to get these codes yourself from the official website, then enter them here manually.
