## Important: Why Railway Credentials are Needed in Train Seat App

> When you search on the e-ticket website or the Rail Sheba app, you must be signed in with your railway credentials. Technically, this is required because the railway server checks whether you are an authorised user before allowing access to the data. Without valid credentials, no information can be fetched from the official server.
